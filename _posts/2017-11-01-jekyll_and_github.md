## purpose
---
Create somewhere to record what I do, on the off chance I'll need to know how I did it at some point.

## what
---
Use Jekyll and git to host a static website on github.io.

##  steps
---

-   create a repo on GitHub
-   test basic index.html on github.io
-   create CNAME file in repo
-   create two A recorda in DNS pointing to IP addresses from GitHub.
-   test basic index.html on custom URL
-   install jekyll
-   test local jekyll webserver
-   push jekyll to github.io
-   select and integrate a theme
-   start keeping notes
-   **to do:** include a few more details so you can do this again

c.d.
